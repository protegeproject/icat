2.  Restricted  and  Repetitive  Behaviors  Groups  were defined  based  on  Cuccaro  et  al’s (2003)  factors:  Repetitive Sensory Motor motion phenotype Actions (RSMA) and Resistance to Change. For clarity, we refer to the latter as Insistence on Sameness (IS) throughout this article (Shao et al 2003). Eight ADI-R items were summed to yield RSMA (five items) and IS (three items) scores. Higher scores indicate greater levels of impairment. Participants missing any item were excluded, slightly reducing sample sizes. Confirmatory factor analyses using MPlus 3.0 replicated Cucca-ro’s factors in this sample (see Bishop et al 2006). Groups were as follows:? LRSMA (low RSMA): score " 4 ? MRSMA (medium RSMA): score ! 5 or 6 ? HRSMA (high RSMA): score " 6 ? LIS (Low IS): score ! 0? MIS (medium IS): score ! 1 or 2 ? HIS (high IS): score " 2
