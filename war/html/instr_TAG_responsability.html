	The <b>Primary TAG</b> is not inherited to the child categories (it is inherited as an "Involved TAG").
	
	The <b>Other Involved TAGs</b> are inherited to the child categories. The inherited TAGs are shown in gray color
	and in italic font and cannot be removed. To remove an inherited TAG, please remove it from the category 
	where it is inherited from.
