Characterizing Phenotype GroupsBased on previous research, we formed the following groups:  1. Language Acquisition Groups defined based on ADI-R items 9 (Age of First Words) and 10 (Age of First Phrases). Individuals were grouped as follows:? NDW (not delayed words): acquired words " 24 months ? DW (delayed words): acquired words " 24 months? NW (no words): no words at time of ADI-R? NDP (not delayed phrases): acquired phrases " 33 months) ? DP (delayed phrases): acquired phrases " 33 months)? NP (no phrases): no phrases at time of ADI-R)  2.  Restricted  and  Repetitive  Behaviors  Groups  were defined  based  on  Cuccaro  et  al’s (2003)  factors:  Repetitive 
Sensory Motor Actions (RSMA) and Resistance to Change. For clarity, we refer to the latter as Insistence on Sameness (IS) throughout this article (Shao et al 2003). Eight ADI-R items were summed to yield RSMA (five items) and IS (three items) scores. Higher scores indicate greater levels of impairment. Participants missing any item were excluded, slightly reducing sample sizes. Confirmatory factor analyses using MPlus 3.0 replicated Cucca-ro’s factors in this sample (see Bishop et al 2006). Groups were as follows:? LRSMA (low RSMA): score " 4 ? MRSMA (medium RSMA): score ! 5 or 6 ? HRSMA (high RSMA): score " 6 ? LIS (Low IS): score ! 0? MIS (medium IS): score ! 1 or 2 ? HIS (high IS): score " 2  3. The Savant Skills Factor was based on Tadevosyan-Leyfer et al’s (2003) savant factor (used in Nurmi et al 2003), with current and ever scores of four ADI-R items: visuospatial ability, memory skill, musical ability, and computational ability. Item scores were summed and divided by total number of items to generate a score between 0 and 1. Higher scores indicate more savant skills. Participants were then divided into two groups: Savant-positive  and  Savant-negative (see  Nurmi  et  al 2003). Savant-positive indicates presence of at least one savant skill. Missing scores were coded 0.
