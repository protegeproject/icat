  <!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: re: explicit NAMESPACE declarations
    
    1) It's good practice to declare the default namespace (xmlns=""), as it provides an explicit context for any element reference in this
    OWL file that isn't given an explicit namespace prefix.
    
    2) Note the default namespace (xmlns="") is NOT the same as the BASE namespace (xml:base), which is the base for forming URIs to 
    any entities defined within this OWL file and can be considered the base URL for this ontology.  They are often the same, 
    but there is no requirement they be the same.  In other words, if you were to set the default to the OWL spec 
    (e.g., xmlsns="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"), then all elements named without a prefix will be assumed to come from 
    the OWL spec and not assumed to be defined in this document. Only when the default (xmlns="") and the base (xml:base="") are 
    identical, will it be assumed elements without a prefix must defined in the body of this file.
    
    3) If you don't NEED to use a namespace in your OWL file, DO NOT create it, as its likely to just create compatibility problems
    that will vary depending on the tool you use. It MAY be OK to creat namespace declaration to anticipate those namespaces used 
    by other ontologies included via owl:imports.
